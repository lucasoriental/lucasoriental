I contributed to the improvement of the performance of requests to the Back-end through the analysis of the CloudIBM and Cirrus platforms. I worked on the analysis and correction of vulnerabilities related to Cookies, CORS, and PseudoRandom Number using SonarQube. I used React (Hooks, Redux, NextJS, Router, Axios, Context) as the main development tool. I built unit tests using Jest and performed test automation with Selenium. I prepared reports and test results in .Docx, .pdf, and .xls formats for presentation during meetings. I modernized the design of the web application using Carbon Design components. I was recognized for my effort, dedication, and commitment to work, as I did a good teamwork and solved tasks efficiently. I worked on the analysis and approval of Pull Requests (GitHub) in DEV, UAT, and PROD environments."
